# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Codec Technologies 1-Month Artificial Intelligence Internship** program.  
The goal of this project is to **predict whether a customer will leave (churn)** based on historical data and to identify the **key factors influencing customer decisions**.

By using machine learning classification models, this project helps businesses understand customer behavior and take proactive steps to retain customers.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a customer will **churn or stay**.
- Analyze customer behavior patterns using **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**.
- Identify key features contributing to churn.
- Build and evaluate a **classification model** to predict churn probability.

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- The dataset contains customer information such as:
  - **Gender**
  - **Tenure**
  - **Internet Service**
  - **Contract Type**
  - **Monthly & Total Charges**
  - **Churn (Target Variable)**

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Google Colab)
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  

---

## 🧩 Steps Followed
1. **Data Loading** – Loaded and viewed the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, handled categorical variables, dropped unused columns.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Created 10 insightful charts showing churn trends.
4. **Feature Encoding** – Converted categorical columns to numerical form.
5. **Model Building** – Trained a **Random Forest Classifier**.
6. **Model Evaluation** – Checked accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
7. **Feature Importance** – Identified top predictors for customer churn.

## 📊 Visualization Insights (10 Charts)
- Customer distribution by gender and churn.
- Churn rate by contract type.
- Relationship between tenure and churn.
- Monthly charges vs churn.
- Internet service type vs churn.
- Payment method vs churn.
- Senior citizens churn trend.
- Dependents vs churn.
- Tenure distribution.
- Feature importance chart.

---

## 🧠 Model Used
- **Random Forest Classifier**
  - Accuracy: **~85–90%**
  - Handles both categorical and numeric data efficiently.

---

## 💡 Key Findings
- **Month-to-month contracts** show the highest churn.
- Customers with **higher monthly charges** tend to churn more.
- **Long-term contracts** reduce churn significantly.
- **Tenure** and **Contract type** are the most important churn predictors.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Try advanced algorithms like **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, or **ANNs**.
- Use customer feedback data for better prediction.
- Deploy this model as a **web-based dashboard or API** for real-time churn prediction.
